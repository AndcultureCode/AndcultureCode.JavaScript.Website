                                <p>After working with CCA on improving their website to provide a better cyber school experience (see our previous work), they saw the need to bring together families, students, and educators in a learning community. They realized the only way to successfully engage with their community was to replace their existing learning platform. CCA needed us to work our magic and develop a new platform designed with the student at the center: edio. Our partnership marked the beginning of an amazing journey towards redefining education, one experience at a time.<span className="easter-egg__right"></span></p>

                    <p>Education in many ways is a broken reality, a product molded by policy and decisions that idealize an unrealistic version of students and teachers that couldn't be further from reality.  We utilized human-centered design as a way to know the real people, the everyday struggles of students, teachers, and parents, empathizing with them and building solutions with each of them at the center. </p>

                    <p>To fully understand how to create the right platform, we started with a discovery phase. We wanted to ask the right questions and let them guide our way. We traveled the state and visited seven sites. We learned the stories of the student, the parent, the teacher, and the administrator and immersed ourselves in their world. We held co-creative workshops with CCA staff members and did a deep competitive analysis of product features. We created personas and defined roles. And, we created affinity maps through way too many sticky notes that tied the features to these personas. It was fun, we promise. </p>

                    <p>We then synthesized all this extensive research. We started the process of mapping user journey flows and we outlined what those product flows would look like. We defined through diagrams what the roles of users and systems were in how they process data and what integrations were the most valuable. We tested how other systems would integrate with edio. FYI, edio has over 30 third party content integrations that seamlessly allow for creating hybrid courses incorporating external resources. Impressive, we know! </p>

                    <p>Once we knew what we needed, the visual design process began. There were hundreds of rough sketches; we aren't kidding. Simultaneously, we did style explorations to hone in the right visual language and identity for the platform. Because, you know, it’s all in the little details.</p>
