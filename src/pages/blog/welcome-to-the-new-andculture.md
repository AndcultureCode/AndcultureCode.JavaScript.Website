andculture is home to more than 80 talented, special and unique humans coming together, with the sole purpose of designing and making an impact in the world around us. Our humble beginnings started 20 years ago with a tight-knit group of recent and determined college grads. Even though we are somewhat larger now, we never lost that tenacity or our fondness for the next, "What if?"

**andculture started at the cusp of the dotcom fever, and our hustle and ambition have always seemed to overrun our size and zip code.**

Out of our little office on Locust Street, we produced incredibly functional and beautifully designed websites, intriguing digital product ideas and mind-blowing thinking for clients across the country. We steadily matured our ethos as an experience design company that not only researches, imagines, strategizes and designs the work, but also builds and deploys it. “Design thinking” wasn’t something we ever had to adopt —  it was just what we did.

Both shockingly and not, life happens in real-time. Partners Dave (CEO), Evan, and Josh couldn’t have predicted their own or andculture’s future 20 years ago when they were starting their business and their families. But they did know it had to stay genuine to who they are and why the company was founded.

Fast forward to 2019: It was clear that the andculture brand — what it stood for as a culture, set of beliefs and values — was ready for its new phase to be put into words. So we did.

> We are here to reimagine and solve realities that no longer make sense, or have become a barrier to what could be so much more.

So, what does that mean for you and those we work with? Well … we ask a lot of questions, we do a lot of listening, and we do a lot of digging deep, both within ourselves and those we partner with. Every time a new client comes through our doors or gets on a conference call to discuss a new initiative, our objective is to get to really understand what we're hearing. Every client is just as unique as the solution, and to get to that solution, we need to understand what makes that partner tick. In doing so, we get to the heart of the issue, because a surface level solution is nothing but a temporary patch.

Getting to the heart of the problem and fixing that problem from the inside out is what reroutes and changes realities. All of our detective work and conversations culminate to that “A-ha” moment where clarity is reached and we can all say, “This is it! We get it.” That invigorates and propels us into designing and building the solution that both parties are passionate about. There is no inherent magic, it’s something we make together.

Because andculture is the body of people who come together, collectively, and make the work every day,  you can understand why our team's hand paintings and doodles are a key part of our visual identity.

You can understand why our language is so friendly and approachable: because we’re humans talking to humans and creating for humans.

And finally, you can understand why our new look is so vibrant and alive: because this is who we are.

**We are an independent design company, with the start-up soul, the hustle that kept us going for 20 years, and the purpose to make the world a better place by blending strategy, design, engineering, technology and ingenuity into one unique combination, every single time.**

This is andculture (and no, we don’t capitalize the “a”). We are a design company, designing the world around us, one experience at a time.
