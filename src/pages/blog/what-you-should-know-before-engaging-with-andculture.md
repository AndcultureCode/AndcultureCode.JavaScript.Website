andculture excels in ambiguity. If you know you need to solve a complicated problem, and know the solution involves the interaction of humans and technology, but you can’t find an off-the-shelf solution, you might need a custom solution purpose-built to solve your problem.

andculture’s partners (that’s what we call our clients, because it really is a partnership) are dreamers, innovators, and extremely talented leaders who have the moxie to venture into new territories where there isn’t a conventional playbook. We aren’t for people who want to play it safe.

But because our work is always an adventure into the unknown, it can be really hard to know how to engage with us. *How exactly do you procure something that doesn’t exist?*

### Like Meatloaf says, “Two Out of Three Ain’t Bad”
Every project is measured across three fairly simply axes: time, budget, and scope. Every partner wants to know “How long will this take? How much will it cost? What will I get for the investment?”

This is where operating as a true partnership is really important. At andculture, we have to work hand in hand with our partners to answer those questions together. Let’s look at each aspect:

* **Time:** You may have an idea of timing for your project, but because the solution doesn’t already exist (or you would have bought it), any firm timeline is bound to be difficult. Often we begin a project with a high level and general approach that is refined through each phase of the project.

    It’s like trying to understand the surface of the moon: from the earth (today), we may have one idea, but by the time we build the rocket, define the plan, and finally approach the surface, the granularity of our understanding is so much clearer. At the start of the project, the time it takes to do it will be a range at best, but we will refine that together.
* **Budget:** We are thoughtful about estimating our projects and do our best to stick within those budgets, but buying great design or custom software isn’t the same as buying something that is well-understood or clearly defined. Because of that, we emphasize partnership with our clients. The clearer we are on your budget, the better we can right-size the scope (make sure it's as accurate as possible).

    That said, our team pours their hearts into their work and they have extremely valuable experience and skills. If your budget is more appropriate for your nephew in college who will build a website for beer money, please call him instead. There are all kinds of projects, and we aren't doing you a favor by taking on small scope web design projects.

    andculture exists to tackle the really hard challenges, where there is no playbook and where you have to nail the design, and it is valuable to have a great partner when you’re walking an unknown path.
* **Scope:** Our approach is to acknowledge that we can’t possibly know everything about your organization and your project when we decide to work together. We have to leave room to learn along the way. Some of our potential partners want to define the scope clearly before they engage with us, and that’s understandable &mdash; we want to know what we will get for our investment. But we work to build mutual trust because there is risk in venturing into the unknown.

    Innovation isn’t easy and creating something new is a messy process. We use an agile approach, rapidly prototyping and iterating. If you aren’t familiar with an agile approach, it involves continuously releasing workable deliverables, so that at any point our partners have something tangible and valuable in hand.

    In this way, the scope continues to evolve and each step we take defines the rest of the path. This flexible approach allows us to design and build what we actually *should* design and build, not what we *thought* we should build when we signed the agreement.

    We love this organic and co-creative process, but we also recognize that your lawyer might not, which is why we work hard to be up front in the business development cycle. We want you to engage with us because you believe we will add value, but you need to know that the relationship (and scope) will evolve as we work together.

### So how do we actually accomplish anything? How our process kicks off, explained.
We are super passionate about the end users of a system. If it’s not designed with them in mind, it won’t work. This is human-centered design. Often, our partners aren’t the end users (we’re a B2B company, so we serve organizations that are serving humans).

This gets a little complicated, because you want our team to design something incredible for you, but in order to do that, we need to talk to the ultimate users of your system.

So the first step in almost all of our engagements is a **Discovery** phase. We dive into your organization and aim to understand the humans involved in the system, the business case (*why* you want to do this work) and what constraints exist in the system. We ask *so* many questions. Our researchers, anthropologists, analysts, engineers and designers want to get to the heart of what you’re trying to accomplish and to understand who will use the things we build.

At the end of that research, we have a much clearer path, which usually includes **delivering a report on that research**, a **clearer scope** (or multiple scopes), **high-level designs**, and a **roadmap**.

This is when it gets really exciting! Now we know where we are going together. The steps might not all be filled in, but we’ve got a working relationship in place so we know how to resolve any issues that arise.

We move projects into **design of the technology/experience** and then into **development**. Throughout that process, our multidisciplinary teams work together so that the right and left brain perspectives of designers and developers are always collaborating with your team. And then we test to make sure we're getting things right, all the while reporting back to you on progress and collaborating along the way.

### What you really need to know
Innovation is magic. It really is.

But it’s also difficult. There’s beauty in the clash of perspectives. It’s hard. You have to sacrifice the good for the better and the better for the great. That means leaning into our values:

* Generosity
* Curiosity
* Confidence
* Courage
* Vulnerability
* Optimism

Without those ingredients, it’s hard to form great partnerships. We are humans, designing digital experiences for other humans. It’s messy and magical and at the root of it is a team that’s unafraid to roll up our sleeves and co-create with you. That’s what working with andculture is like and what I wish our partners knew when they consider working with us.

### Final pieces of advice

* **Ask questions** &mdash; lots of them. We’ve never met a question mark we didn’t like.
* **We aren’t perfect; we are human.** If any salesperson ever promises you perfection, please understand that it’s not happening.
* **It won’t be easy, but it will be good.** The best things aren't found at the end of the easiest paths.
* **We are audacious enough to dream and we actually care about what we do.** It’s people like us that create the future.
